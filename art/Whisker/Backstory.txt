Title: Whisker: The Quest for Laughter

Whisker was born the most serious cat in the playful village of Meowstone. 
While others laughed and tumbled, he stayed silent and stern. 
But when he learns that true happiness lies in embracing silliness, 
Whisker sets off on a wild adventure across goofy lands to discover his 
humor — and finally become a normal cat.
